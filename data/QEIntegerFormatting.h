/*!
  This class holds formatting instructions and uses them to convert to/from an
  integer and a QVariant of any type.
  It is generally set up with it's formatting instructions and then passed to a
  QEInteger class that will sink and source integer data to widgets or other code.
  It is used to convert data to and from a QCaObject (which sources and sinks data
  in the form of a QVariant where the QVariant reflects the underlying variable
  data type) and the QEInteger class.
  An example of a requirement for integer data is a combo box which must
  determine an integer index to select a menu option.
